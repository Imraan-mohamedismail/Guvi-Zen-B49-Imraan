objects and its internal representation in Javascript:

In JavaScript, objects are one of the most fundamental and versatile data types. They are used to store and manipulate data in the form of key-value pairs and can represent complex entities or data structures. Understanding how objects are internally represented in JavaScript is crucial for optimising code performance and avoiding potential pitfalls.

Object Creation and Properties
In JavaScript, objects can be created using various methods, such as object literal notation, constructor functions, and classes (introduced in ES6).

Example:

const person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
  gender: 'male'
};
